Building the M2 has always been a goal of ours. Our crowdfunding campaign was the catalyst that transformed us from friends and an idea to a company and a product. We are very thankful to everyone who enabled this transformation. We repay you through our hard work and dedication to this project.\nWe would also like to thank the organizations that have helped build the communities that the M2 relies on: Arduino, DIGI International, Digi-Key, the EFF, Hackaday, and Open Garages. Finally, to the developers who spend their own time building essential tools, answering questions on the forum, and testing, thank you.\nDevice Summary\n\nM2 by Macchina is an open and versatile automotive interface that can take your car to the next level. Use it to customize your ride or as a development platform for your next product. M2 works with almost any vehicle and features an SAM3X ARM Cortex-M3 processor at its core---the same processor as the Arduino Due. An XBee form factor socket allows for many wireless capabilities.\nYou can ead more about M2 general features on our website.\nGoals\nAs we developed the Macchina M2, we set out with the following goals:\n\nHelp foster a new generation of car nerds\nDevelop an innovative product for a wide range of automotive functions\nSupport the DIY and Open Source ecosystem\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping\nDisplay our ability to develop and mass produce quality hardware\n\nSpecification\nThe M2 is an open source automotive interface that takes the form of an OBD2 \"under-the-Dash\" dongle or hard-wired \"under-the-hood\" device. Each M2 has all the interface circuitry needed to connect to the 5+ standard OBD2 protocols plus other interfaces such as a second CAN bus, LIN bus, and single-wire CAN.  It also includes several options for connections to the outside world including: SD card, USB Device and Host, 20-pin (sort of standard) XBee socket, and a general purpose connector.\n\nWe designed the M2 to be modular and the result was three main related, but independent, components.\nThe M2 Interface Board provides most of the hardware support for automotive connections. The goal was for M2 to be able to interface and communicate with as many cars as possible. We crammed 2 channels of CAN, 2 channels of LIN/K-LINE, a J1850 VPW/PWM and even a single-wire CAN (GMLAN) interface onto the board. Automotive environments require the M2 to be seriously strong, so we built in plenty of protection circuitry. Lastly, we have 6 general purpose driver circuits, which can source and sink up to 1 amp of current at 12 volts!\nThe M2 Processor Board is the standard computing engine for the Macchina M2.  We chose the Arduino Due as the basis of M2's processor board. Shrinking the Due by well over 50% was no small task! We decided to make further improvements by using the High Speed SD card interface and writing the appropriate firmware libraries to allow for faster data logging. We also added several LED options and a couple switches for a more pleasant development experience. Lastly, we tacked on an EEPROM to store variables after power is cut to M2.  The processor BCB can be swapped with a Breakout Board to more easily use the M2 Interface Board with your choice of processor.\nA wireless socket on the M2 Processor Board accommodates a wide variety of wireless options using the popular DIGI XBee form factor socket. Many inexpensive, plug-and-play boards already exist including BLE, WIFI, GSM, 3G, LTE, GPS and others. This can even be used to reprogram the M2 wirelessly.\n"},"m2/versions.html":{"url":"m2/versions.html","title":"Versions of M2","keywords":"","body":"Versions of M2\n\nThere exist multiple versions of M2, the picture above shows several easy to spot differences between V3 and earlier and V4. Most notably are the white buttons and larger arrow indicator on the V4.\nFor the majority of use cases, the version of the M2 will have little effect.\n"},"m2/disclaimer.html":{"url":"m2/disclaimer.html","title":"Disclaimer","keywords":"","body":"Safety\nYour car might be the best hacking canvas you own, but it is also inherently dangerous. Please be familiar with our user agreement and always use best practices when working with cars. Follow the manufacturer's procedure recommendations, don’t operate on a moving vehicle, simulate ideas on a bench, and don’t test on public roads.\n"},"m2/getting-started/":{"url":"m2/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nWhat’s in the Box?\nInside your box you should find the following:\n\n\nM2 (UTD or UTH)\n26 pin cable harness kit\n24 pin cable harness kit (UTH version only)\nWindow sticker\nStart up card\n\nUsing your M2\nThere are many ways you can write code and work with M2. One of the quickest and easiest ways is to use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is what this documentation will use. Many other development environments work well including Atmel Studio and Simulink®.\nThe first thing you will need to do is set up the Arduino IDE.  After that you might choose to build and run an existing project or write something your own.  There are many libraries available for the M2 and most include examples sketchs that you can run on your M2.\nEnclosures\nIt is ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.\nFind more about enclosures here.\n"},"m2/getting-started/arduino.html":{"url":"m2/getting-started/arduino.html","title":"Arduino IDE Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Arduino IDE Quick Start\nBy completing this guide you will configure the Arduino IDE for developing on the Macchina M2 and run your first sketch on the M2.  This will verify both your Arduino IDE setup and your M2 device.\nThe following steps are needed to get started programming on the Macchina M2 with the Arduino IDE:\n\nInstall the Arduino Desktop IDE\nInstall the Macchina M2 Board Configuration\nInstall drivers\nBuild and upload a sketch\n\nArduino Desktop IDE\nFollow the official installation instructions for your operating system then return here to continue with Macchina M2 specific setup.\n\nWindows\nmacOS\nLinux\n\nMacchina M2 Board Configuration\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE Installed, you will add support for the for Macchina M2.\nFirst, you will tell the IDE where to find the Macchina board configuration files.

This tells the Arduino IDE where to look to find the board configuration files for Macchina boards.\nNext, you will open the Boards Manager to download the needed board configurations.  Find the board manager under Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Boards Manager...\nIn the board manager, install Arduino SAM Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino.  Then install Macchina SAM Boards (Install Arduino SAM Boards first) by Macchina.\nNote: If for any reason you cannot use the Board Manager to install the board configuration files, you have the option to do a manual install but will not benefit from the updates notification provided by the Board Manager when new versions are released.\nDrivers\nYou may need to install a driver to enable your computer to communicate with the Macchina M2 before you can send sketches to it.  The Macchina M2 is based on the Arduino Due and uses the same driver.  Please visit the official Arduino Due documentation for instructions on installing drivers.\nBe careful when plugging the micro-USB cable into your M2.  The M2's design allows you to put it in a case or enclosure.  The connector cable may stick out farther than you expect, because there needs to be clearance space for a case.\nWhen you have finished installing drivers, leave your Macchina M2 plugged into the computer.\nRunning your first sketch\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE setup and your M2 connected, you can run your first sketch on the M2 by performing the followings steps in the Arduino IDE.\nFirst, you will make Macchina M2 the active board.  Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Macchina M2.\nNext, select the port that your M2 is using. Tools > Port.\nNext, open the Blink sketch. File > Examples > 01. Basics > Blink.\nFinally, in the opened window, upload the sketch to your M2 board.  Sketch > Upload.\nIt will take a few moments for the sketch to be written as firmware to your Macchina M2.  You can watch the progress at the bottom of the IDE window.  When the upload has completed, you should see a flashing LED on your Macchina M2.\nCongratulations!  You have now configured your computer for development on the M2 and run your first program.  As a next step, you may choose to learn the names of the other LEDs on the Macchina M2 using the pin mapping.  Then you can practice modifying the sketch to make other LEDs blink.\nYou may also wish to explore the other sketches under the Examples menu.  Most libraries include examples which can be accessed by the Examples menu after the library is installed.  The Macchina M2 Board Configuration you installed includes some libraries which will be listed under the Examples for Macchina M2 section of the Examples menu.\nResetting M2\nIf for some reason your M2 cannot be found by your computer, both in the Arduino IDE and the Device Manager, the M2 can be reset through the following process:\n\nConnect the M2 to power.\nHold down the ERASE button.\nWhile still holding the ERASE button down, press the RESET button.\n\n"},"m2/technical-references/installation.html":{"url":"m2/technical-references/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nThe Macchina M2 was designed to be modular to give you the option of many installation options. The under-the-dash (UTD) version plugs directly into the OBD2 port of any modern car. The under-the-hood (UTH) version can be spliced into a wire harness. A connector is the only difference between the 2 versions.\n\nUnder-the-Dash (UTD)\nThe \"Under-the-Dash\" version of the M2 plugs directly into the OBD2 port of the modern car. Any car built after 1996 has an OBD2 port near the steering wheel, under the dash.\n\nThe OBD2 connector is a 16 pin connector that provides power and a data connection.

This connector takes the form of a 24-pin pluggable connector. Typical usage for this connector would be a more permanent installation where M2 would be hard-wired or spliced into an existing cable harness.\n\nThe image below shows the pin orientation of the 24 pin connector.

It is a message-based protocol that allows modules within a car to communicate with one another. While the physical layer is understood and open, the actual meaning of the messages sent over the bus are not. While some messages are legislated to be \"standard\", the majority of CAN messages in your typical car are not well documented.\nThe M2 has 2 CAN channels (in addition to the single-wire CAN channel) that can interface directly to the CAN bus network of your car. The M2 uses the 2 built-in CAN controllers found in the SAM3X and 2 external TJA1051 transceivers. Here is a typical example:\n\nHere is the link to the datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1051.pdf\nCAN bus connections can be found on either the 16-pin OBD2 connector on the under-the-dash M2 or the 24-pin connector used by the under-the-hood M2.\n\nSingle-wire CAN\nThe Macchina M2 provides single-wire CAN support using a MCP2515 CAN controller.\nLIN\nLocal Interconnect Network bus is an inexpensive, single wire, serial network protocol used in many modern cars. Typically, LIN would be used to control and monitor lower-priority devices such as seat positions, door locks, radio and illumination.\nThe M2 has 2 LIN channels that can interface directly to the LIN bus network of your car. Your M2 uses 2 external TJA1027 transceivers connected via UART to the processor.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1027.pdf\nNote that the TJA1027 transceiver is used for both LIN and ISO9141 (K-LINE/L-LINE) for a total of 2 channels.\nLIN bus connections can be found on either the 16-pin OBD2 connector on the under-the-dash M2 or the 24-pin connector used by the under-the-hood M2.\nK-line (aka ISO9141, KWP2000)\nISO9141/K-line is typically found in Chrysler, European, and Asian vehicles built before around 2005. This protocol is similar to RS-232 but at different voltage levels and on a single, bidirectional line.\nSome cars require a secondary line (sometimes referred to as L-Line).\nM2 has two K-line channels and uses the TJA1027 transceiver to interface the 12-volt single bidirectional line from the vehicle to a 3.3V UART connection. While this part is designed for LIN, it is also K-line compatible. Here is typical interface circuit showing a channel of ISO9141/LIN connected to the UART channel of the processor.\nK-line connections can be found on either the 16-pin OBD2 connector on the under-the-dash M2 or the 24-pin connector used by the under-the-hood M2.\n\nHere is the link to the datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1027.pdf\nJ1850\nM2 supports both J1850 PWM (Pulse-width-modulation) and VPW (Variable Pulse width).\nJ1850 PWM is typically found in older Ford vehicles and operates at 41.6 kb/s. The bus is active when J1850+_BUS is pulled HIGH to 5V and J1850-_BUS is pulled LOW to 0V.\nJ1850 VPW is typically found in older GM vehicles and operates at 10.4 kb/s.\nThe voltage range for each protocol is different (0-7V for VPW and 0-5V for PWM). To change between the levels required for PWM and VPW variants of J1850, use this signal:\nJ1850_PWM_VPW (M2 board signal name \"J1850_PWM_nVPW\")\nThis signal is connected to physical pin 123 (PB8) of the SAM3X. Make this pin HIGH for PWM and LOW for VPW\nThe following code that will both turn on power to J1850 circuit AND set level for either PWM or VPW:\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(PS_J1850_9141, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(J1850_PWM_VPW, OUTPUT);\n\n  digitalWrite(PS_J1850_9141, HIGH);  // LOW  = no power at +12V_SW/+5V_SW\n                                      // HIGH = power at +12V_SW/+5V_SW\n\n  digitalWrite(J1850_PWM_VPW, HIGH);       // LOW  = ~7.9v (VPW)\n                                      // HIGH = ~5.9V (PWM)\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n}\n\nThese signals originate from the vehicle:\nJ1850+_BUS connects to pin 2 on the OBD2 port and is used by BOTH J1850 PWM and VPW.\nJ1850-_BUS connects to pin 10 on the OBD2 port and is used by J1850 PWM\nThese signals connect to the processor as OUTPUTS:\nJ1850P_TX (M2 board signal name \"J1850+_TX\") is an OUTPUT from the processor used for BOTH J1850 PWM and VPW. \"J1850+_TX\" is connected to pin 45 or PC18. This corresponds to the PWMH6 on peripheral B.\n\nWith J1850_PWM_VPW = HIGH (i.e. PWM mode): When this signal goes HIGH , pin 2 of the OBD2 connector is 5.5V. When this pin is LOW, pin 2 of the OBD2 connector is 0V.\n\nWith J1850_PWM_VPW = LOW (i.e. VPW mode): When this signal goes HIGH , pin 2 of the OBD2 connector is 7.5V. When this pin is LOW, pin 2 of the OBD2 connector is 0V.\n\n\nJ1850N_TX (M2 board signal name \"J1850-_TX\") is an OUTPUT from the processor and is used for J1850 PWM. \"J1850-_TX\" is connected to pin 7 or PC23. This corresponds to the PWML6 on peripheral B.\n\nWith J1850_PWM_VPW = HIGH (i.e. PWM mode): When this signal goes HIGH , pin 10 of the OBD2 connector is 0V. When this pin is LOW, pin 10 of the OBD2 connector is 5V.\n\nPWMH6 and PWML6 functionality is described in section 38: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of the SAM3X datasheet.\nThese signals connect to the processor as INPUTS:\nJ1850_PWM_RX is an INPUT to the processor. \"J1850_PWM_RX\" is connected to pin 3 or PC28. This corresponds to the TIOA7 on peripheral B.\nJ1850_VPW_RX is an INPUT to the processor. \"J1850_VPW_RX\" is connected to pin 4 or PC26. This corresponds to the TIOB6 on peripheral B.\nTIOB6 and TIOA7 functionality is described in section 36: Timer Counter (TC) of the SAM3X datasheet.\n"},"m2/technical-references/communication.html":{"url":"m2/technical-references/communication.html","title":"Communication","keywords":"","body":"Communication\nXBee-compatible socket\nM2 has an XBee-compatible form factor socket on the top of the processor board.

Make sure that it is oriented correctly with the angled chamfers pointed toward the USB/SD side of your M2.  Please make sure your M2 is not being powered when plugging in the modem.\nBefore plugging the modem into your M2, make sure to install a SIM card. This modem uses a 4FF (Nano) size SIM card.\n\nPower\nAs you work with the Digi modem, please keep in mind that it requires more power that your computer can provide directly over a USB port.

We've designed these circuits to make it easy to connect up both 12 volt inputs AND outputs. This would include things like LEDs, buzzers, sensors, gauges, switches, and solenoids.\nOutput\nThe six general purpose 12-volt driver circuits consist of 2 types: High side and low side.\n\nChannels 1, 2 and 3 are HIGH side drivers that switch the output to +12V. (aka SOURCE)\nChannels 4, 5 and 6 are LOW side drivers that switch the output to GND. (aka SINK)\n\n\nNote about current limits: Each channel is capable of sourcing or sinking around 1 amp of current at 12 volts before the protection fuses opens. Of course, this is a MAXIMUM and depends ambient temperature, duty cycle, etc. Also note that drawing the maximum current over all 6 channels at the same time would most likely exceed the limit of your car's OBD2 port fuse. To ensure a better understanding of all of this, we've implemented a current monitoring circuit.\nWhen sourcing power, the 12V rail is monitored by an internal current monitor. The goal is to be able to dynamically measure how much power an external device is using AND ensure the total power pulled from the OBD2 port does not exceed X amps and open the car's OBD2 fuse.\nHere is a cool example of a tachometer gauge connected directly to M2 and displaying actual RPM as read from the CAN bus:\n\nInput\nM2 has six 12-volt-range input channels.

Since the PocketBeagle is not keyed, be sure to plug it in so that the USB ports are on the same side.\nPlug the OTG adapter into the Adapter board and the powered USB hub into that adapter. Plug the WIFI dongle into the hub. Your setup should look like this:\n\nStep 2: Create a bootable SD card\nFollow instructions here to create a bootable SD card. Once you have a bootable SD card, plug it into the PocketBeagle.\nPlug a microUSB cable into the PocketBeagle and your computer. After a minute or so, use your favorite terminal to ssh to 192.168.7.2\nLogin: debian\nPassword: temppwd\nStep 2.5: Change your password (optional but recommended)\nWe want to make sure that others wont be able to access your device to do this the main thing we are going to do is change the root password.\nsudo passwd root\nStep 3: Connect to internet.\nFirst thing we'll want to do is connect to the internet to be able to download the latest packages. To do that, we'll use WIFI. Type the commands as shown below\nsudo connmanctl\nconnmanctl> enable wifi\nEnabled wifi\nconnmanctl> scan wifi\nScan completed for wifi\nconnmanctl> services\nAll of the hotspots that your setup can see will be listed here, and look something like this:\nwifi_xxxxxx_xxxxxx_managed_psk\nRun these commands to connect:\nconnmanctl> agent on\n\nconnmanctl> connect wifi_xxxxxx_xxxxxx_managed_psk\n\nPassphrase? xxxxxxxxxxx\n\nconnected wifi_xxxxxx_xxxxxx_managed_psk\n\nconnmanctl> quit\nYou should now be connected to your local wifi. You can check that you have an IP address by typing the following in the terminal window:\nifconfig\nYou should now see an IP address under wlan0 and you can now connect to this IP address in the future to program your PocketBeagle.\nStep 4: Install updates and CAN tools.\nNow we run a few commands to update the system and install CAN tools. Type this into the terminal:\nsudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade\nFollow directions during install - should take a couple minutes.\nsudo /opt/scripts/tools/update_kernel.sh\nFollow directions during install - should take a couple minutes.\nsudo reboot\nNow that everything is updated to latest versions, we'll install CAN tools:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git\ncd /tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils.git\ncd can-utils/\nmake\nsudo make install\ncd ~\nNext we make sure the pins on the PocketBeagle are set up correctly as shown at this link:\nhttps://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki/Peripherals#can\nType this into terminal:\nconfig-pin P1_28 can\nconfig-pin P1_26 can\nStep 5: print out CAN messages\nNext, we set up the CAN interface and turn it on. Note that we are setting rate at 500Kb/s here. Your car might be a different BAUD rate.\nsudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 listen-only on\n\nsudo ifconfig can0 up\nTo see actual data, we need to do 2 things: 1. Plug M2/PocketBeagle into your car or an emulator (No need for hub, and WIFI dongle anymore - those can be unplugged) and 2. enter this command to print output to terminal screen:\ncandump -cae can0,0:0,#FFFFFFFF\nIf everything is set up correctly, you should see something like this:\n\nWhile this looks pretty cool, it is hard to see what is going on. Press CTRL+C to end output to terminal.\nLogging CAN data to a file makes it easier to analyze the data. To do that, use this command to log data to current working directory:\ncandump -l any,0:0,#FFFFFFFF\nStep 6: Going further.\nNext steps for this program is setting up and using more sophisticated analysis tools.\nNote: At the time of writing this, we were not able to get the WIFI adapter to work without the powered hub in place. Perhaps the USB port on PocketBeagle does not output enough current? M2 Interface board should supply up to 3A at 5V, so more investigation on this subject to follow\n"},"M2VoltageMonitor/":{"url":"M2VoltageMonitor/","title":"Help Collect Voltage Data","keywords":"","body":"M2VoltageMonitor - Help Us Collect Data!\nFollow me\n"},"superB/":{"url":"superB/","title":"About SuperB","keywords":"","body":"SuperB\nSuperB marries two of hardware’s ubiquitous names - the “Bee” form factor and ESP32. The Bee form factor was derived from DIGI’s XBee industrial grade IoT boards. This form factor has long been used to add wireless connectivity to hardware across the board. But in the maturing market of connected items, two protocols stand as required: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. ESP32 brings both, and in an easy-to-use package - giving maximum flexibility to your existing hardware and for your next generation of modular, extensible products.\n\nFeatures and Specifications\n\nOpen source hardware\nXBee form-factor compatible (3.3 V levels, UART, SPI and GPIOs broken out to headers)\nBased on popular ESP32 SoC\nWi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n)\nBluetooth (Classic and BLE)\nProgrammable with many tools, including Arduino IDE\nOTA (Over-the-Air) flashing capable\nDual Core processor up to 240 MHz\nIntegrated 4 MB flash - we may upgrade this to 16 MB\nSleep current is less than 5 μA\nFully certified with integrated antenna and software stacks\nOne programmable LED\n\nWhat can SuperB do for you?\nWe designed SuperB as a wireless solution that plugs into the Bee socket of M2, our automotive interface hardware. Fortunately for you and us, Bee sockets are found everywhere, with over ten million Bee modules deployed to date. Wherever the modular Bee socket is found, SuperB will work. Some examples? SparkFun’s Wireless Joystick Kit and Adafruit’s Tweet-a-watt are two great examples of cool Bee-ready hardware and projects available today.\nSuperB will come preloaded with AT Command code, allowing you to communicate with ESP32 over UART with any microcontroller using standard AT commands. Want to use it like an Arduino? Program SuperB using the Arduino IDE for whatever you are looking to build. You can even program SuperB to act as a wireless bootloader for a host system. Better yet, you can reprogram SuperB to wirelessly connect SavvyCan, creating a wireless car hacking dynamic duo with M2! Check back for instructions and code in a future update!\nExternal Antenna Availability\n\nBuilt-in 'trace' antenna:\nThis is the original SuperB design. It uses the ESP32-WROOM-32D module, and the antenna is built into the device.\nU.FL for external antenna:\nThis option uses the ESP32-WROOM-32U module, and allows you to connect your external antenna via U.FL connector. This option works well when you plan to enclose your SuperB in a metal box, tin foil hat or other material that interferes with antenna reception. Please note that backers need to provide their own antenna solution for this option.\n"},"superB/hardware.html":{"url":"superB/hardware.html","title":"Hardware","keywords":"","body":"The SuperB Hardware\n\n(The SuperB breakout overview, take note of the locations of \"EN\" and \"IO0\")\nTo place SuperB into bootloader mode, EN must be brought low and returned to high while IO0 is held low.
